What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When initializing a repository, I can now control my files on that directory
with Git. I can see what changes and when. I can fix my application' bugged codes
easily.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

I think staging area is like a buffer area or cache memory on microprocessors
it only contains what is needed to be used. And repository can be seen as
microprocessor and repository can be our main memory. All the works
are done in the working area, but only the needed ones go to repository on needed time.
It offers time and work management I think.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

I can only add the files I wanted to commit to staging area and then commit. Since the commit
command only commit those in staging area, only the files I wanted are commited.
Therefore, I can change file(s) logically then commit, then I can also change file(s)
and then commit again.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

When you have no idea whether your new code will work or not or if you wanted to add some
new functions to your program, branches can be helpful. They can achieve this by
adding new features outside of your main line of master branch. So, your main program
will be the same at basics. But you can still testing the program with different codes
in another branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It helps me to understand the structure of branching.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

The result of merging two branches together is using both of these branches features
together in just one unified branch. Because of that we represented it in the diagram
the way we did.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
